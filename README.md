# Show Single Variations Shop & Category for WooCommerce (adapted)

WordPress plugin heavily inspired by [Show Variations On Shop & Category WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-show-single-variations-shop-category/) by Gravity Master.

Thanks to Gravity Master for enabling this.

## Inspiration

I firstly used Gravity Master's plugin but found it not suitable for my needs. So I stripped out everything I didn't need and rewrote other bits.

The plugin's logic has been flipped. The plugin did apply itself to all categories except categories you choose to exclude. In my version is only applies itself to categories you pick.

The cron class isn't needed (and commented out).

## Instructions

If you're to use my adapted plugin you'll almost certainly need to be a developer and adapt it for your purposes.

## Support

None
